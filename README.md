# Internship Studio : Artificial Intelligence Internship
A face recognition system using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks.
# Project Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using MLP classifier along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction. The system can identify faces from a dataset of Bollywood celebrities with good accuracy.
# Key Features
Face detection and recognition using MLP neural network
Dimensionality reduction using PCA and LDA
Dataset of Bollywood celebrity faces
Interactive visualization of eigenfaces
Model training with loss tracking
Prediction probability scores
